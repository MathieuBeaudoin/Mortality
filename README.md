# Mortality

Even wondered what people die of around the World? If the answer is no, you're probably not an actuary!

This repository will contain an exploratory data analysis, with related datasets, that I created for a school project. (I will upload my work after the November 29 deadline).

All datasets are taken from OurWorldInData.org, which contains a treasure trove of all sorts of data about our world.
